This is the M.Tech Final project worked on Music analysis.
🎵 Intelligent Music Analysis using Audio Signal Processing & Machine Learning

An end-to-end music intelligence system that analyzes raw audio signals to understand genre, emotion, and similarity using signal processing and machine learning techniques.

📌 Overview

This project focuses on content-based music analysis, leveraging audio signal processing and machine learning to extract meaningful insights directly from music files — without relying on user metadata.

The system performs:

🎼 Music genre classification

😊 Emotion / mood detection

🔍 Music similarity & recommendation

📊 Rich audio visualizations

The project is designed as an M.Tech-level academic project while following industry best practices for reproducibility, modularity, and experimentation.

🎯 Motivation

Traditional music recommendation systems heavily depend on user behavior. This project instead explores how machines can “understand” music itself by analyzing:

Frequency content

Rhythm and tempo

Harmonic and timbral characteristics

Such approaches are widely used in:

Music streaming platforms

Music information retrieval (MIR)

Audio-based recommendation systems

AI-driven media analytics

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

Time–Frequency Analysis

Feature Engineering on Audio Signals

Classical Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Model Evaluation & Experimentation

End-to-End ML Pipelines
