# # From Audio to Language: Linking Music Analysis to Transformers
#
# This notebook discusses how audio representations can be aligned with
# NLP and Transformer-based architectures.
#
# - Spectrograms as token-like sequences
# - Audio embeddings analogous to word embeddings
# - Future use of Audio Transformers
#
# This bridges audio ML with NLP & LLM research.
